    abstract = {Delayed notification and lack of early information hinder timely hospital based activations in large scale multiple casualty events. We hypothesized that Twitter real-time data would produce a unique and reproducible signal within minutes of multiple casualty events and we investigated the timing of the signal compared with other hospital disaster notification mechanisms. Using disaster specific search terms, all relevant tweets from the event to 7 days post-event were analyzed for 5 recent US based multiple casualty events (Boston Bombing [BB], SF Plane Crash [SF], Napa Earthquake [NE], Sandy Hook [SH], and Marysville Shooting [MV]). Quantitative and qualitative analysis of tweet utilization were compared across events. Over 3.8 million tweets were analyzed (SH 1.8 m, BB 1.1m, SF 430k, MV 250k, NE 205k). Peak tweets per min ranged from 209-3326. The mean followers per tweeter ranged from 3382-9992 across events. Retweets were tweeted a mean of 82-564 times per event. Tweets occurred very rapidly for all events (<2 mins) and represented 1% of the total event specific tweets in a median of 13 minutes of the first 911 calls. A 200 tweets/min threshold was reached fastest with NE (2 min), BB (7 min), and SF (18 mins). If this threshold was utilized as a signaling mechanism to place local hospitals on standby for possible large scale events, in all case studies, this signal would have preceded patient arrival. Importantly, this threshold for signaling would also have preceded traditional disaster notification mechanisms in SF, NE, and simultaneous with BB and MV. Social media data has demonstrated that this mechanism is a powerful, predictable, and potentially important resource for optimizing disaster response. Further investigated is warranted to assess the utility of prospective signally thresholds for hospital based activation.},

    abstract = {Dengue is a fast-growing mosquito-borne viral disease, with an estimated annual incidence of 390 million infections, of which 96 million manifest clinically. Dengue burden is likely to increase in the future. Mentioning a disease in social networks is correlated with physician visits by patients, and can be used to estimate disease activity. Traditional, biologically-focused monitoring techniques, based on laboratory diagnostics, are accurate but costly and slow. Alternative approaches for surveillance aim to capture health-seeking behavior at earlier stages of disease progression, specially capturing the asymptomatic and mild clinic manifestation population who do not seek medical care formally. Twitter data have potential application for Dengue surveillance, improving the estimation and prediction of the disease, in space and time, being a valuable and low-cost addition to assist traditional surveillance. We show that tweets are strongly associated with Dengue cases. Tweets are a useful tool for estimating and forecasting Dengue cases until 8 weeks in the future, both at country and city level, even in less developed areas.},
